Demos of confusing behavior for dynamically created streams, as well as nested streams.

- Single stream: [/single](http://localhost:4000/single) (via SingleLive)
- Multiple streams via an assign: [/assign](http://localhost:4000/assign) (via AssignLive)
- Multiple streams nested under a parent stream: [/nested](http://localhost:4000/nested) (via NestedLive)
